Keep track of whose turn it is to do some stuff!  
##### All data is hardcoded. Any changes will be lost on refresh... (you could implement a nice backend!)

### To Run

#### Vagrant
Set up the vagrant box!  
The box will install all necessary dependencides... This may take a while :(

```
$ vagrant up
```

#### Fire up them engines
ssh into our vagrant box, then build and run the application!

```bash
$ vagrant ssh
#connecting and stuff...

$ gulp clean && gulp build
$ gulp run
```

Surf to localhost:3000

Profit!
